    <p> <b> Royal Challengers Bangalore </b> (often abbreviated as RCB) are a franchise cricket team based in Bengaluru,
      Karnataka, that plays in the Indian Premier League (IPL).
      It was founded in 2008 by United Spirits and named after the company's liquor brand Royal
      Challenge.<sup>[3]</sup>Ahead of the
      2008 player auction, the IPL named Rahul Dravid as the icon player for the Bangalore franchise, which meant that
      Dravid would be paid 15% more than the highest bid player at the auction. </p>
    <p>The franchise acquired a number of Indian and international players at the auction such as Jacques Kallis, Anil
      Kumble, Zaheer Khan, Mark Boucher, Dale Steyn and Cameron White.
      They also signed up Ross Taylor.</p>
