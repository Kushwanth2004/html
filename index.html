        The BCCI was formed in December 1928[dubious discuss] and is a consortium of state cricket associations that
        select their own representatives who elect the BCCI president. Grant Govan was the first BCCI president and
        Anthony De Mello was its first secretary.[18] As of February 2023, Roger Binny is the incumbent BCCI president
        and Jay Shah is secretary.[19][20] The board joined the Imperial Cricket Conference in 1926.[2] The BCCI is an
        autonomous, private organisation that does not fall under the purview of the National Sports Federation of India
        and the Government of India has minimal regulation on it. It does not receive any grants or funds from the
        Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports. The <a

        influential in
        international cricket.[21][22][23] ICC share biggest part of its revenue with the BCCI and its IPL is
        worlds' wealthiest league.[24] </p>
